                    <li>pokemon: woah how obscure. my favourite pokemon is necrozma, especially the ultra forme. thats where the first half of my online username is from. 
                        as for favourite game...sun/moon for the story and maybe legends arceus/sv for gameplay
                    </li>
                    <li>hollow knight: LORE!!! exploration and atmosphere is amazing, i must say im pretty bad at combat though lol</li>
                    <li>minecraft: a classic. you know whats up</li>
                    <li>zelda breath of the wild/tears of the kingdom: once again i think these games dont need more praise as demonstrated by their reception sections in wikipedia</li>
                    <li>celeste: great platforming, great music, great story. also there is a disproportionate amount of programmers i know playing this for some reason</li>
                    <li>portal: hehe me go wooooosh</li>
                    <li>rain world: i must say i havent actually played this but the lore is so good its here anyways</li>

                somehow i watch a lot of animated shows, especially 2d ones. mostly but not all western
                <ul class="stdlist">
                    <li>amphibia: funny found family frog show that turned into an emotional rollercoaster pretty quickly. the reason behind the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olm">second word</a> in my username</li>
                    <li>the owl house: found family show again, but with OWL. really nice story and animation especially in certain sequences</li>
                    <li>infinity train: i like trains. especially cosmic horror "wormhole judgement line" trains. perfect blend of scifi and character development. oh yes and emotional damage too. the inspiration for the styling of this website as well</li>
                    <li>spirited away: studio ghibli is great, and this one is probably my favourite for the world and aesthetic</li>
                    <li>others that i enjoyed but im too lazy to write about now: gravity falls, the netflix she-ra remake, avatar the last airbender, the legend of korra</li>
